# Problem 6
# Problem Statement: The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers
# is, 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
# (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
# natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
# hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
# ANSWER: 25164150
